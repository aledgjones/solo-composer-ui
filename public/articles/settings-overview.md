# Settings Overview

The app produces a highly customisable score and with this comes a lot of settings! I have tried to be as logical about the placement of settings as much as possible. The following is a general overview of each of the setting groups. Hopefully this will find it easier to locate different types of settings.

## Preferences

In the file menu (located at the top left of the screen) you will find a preferences item. The settings within this dialog are preferences that affect the way the app works and behaves. For example the theme. They are applied irrispective of the file that is open.

## Tab Settings

On every tab of the application (Setup, Write, Engrave, Play, Print) you will find a cog icon in the bottom left hand corner. Here you can find settings for the current view. The settings are orgained as such:

### Setup

Here you will find general settings for the current score that effect the way it is displayed on a global level. For example, the style of the auto instrument numbering

### Write

Here you will find settings that affect how note inputing behaves for the current score. For example, the use of double accidentals or the grouping of beamed notes. These settings effect all layouts of the score.

### Engrave

Here you will find settings that effect the style and look of a specific layout type (Score or Part). In the bottom left of the dialog you can switch between the default layout types or create your own.

### Play

Here you will find settings that affect how the score is played back. General device settings can be found in the file menu as they are applied app wide irrespective of the score that is opened.

### Print

Here you will find settings that effect how the score will be printed. For example, page size.
